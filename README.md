# Paint Wars

Kill enemies and descend downwards to increase your level, score multiplier and difficulty. Enemies drop health pick-ups when killed.

One of my first programming projects made for a school assignment in October 2015. The code is terrible and is likely of no use to anyone. Published for archival reasons.
